my little website, everything in lowercase because it's _aesthetic_ (i'm just lazy)

i'm happy about any recommendations or pull requests

## development

```
git clone https://github.com/jurifm2406/website
cd website
pnpm i
pnpm run dev
```

website should be available at `localhost:5173`

## roadmap

-   [ ] migrate `/graph` and `Farbenglitschen` from d3 created dom elements to svelte created dom elements
